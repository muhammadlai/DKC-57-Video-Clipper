## 👋 About the Creator

Hey — I'm **AIONIX**, a **17-year-old** builder who is obsessed with AI and machine learning.

I'm on a mission to prove that powerful tools shouldn't cost money. OpenClip is my first major open-source project — built not by a team, not by a funded startup, but by a teenager with a laptop, a vision, and a lot of caffeine.

> **This project is just getting started.** The roadmap is ambitious and the best features are still being built. If you believe in open-source AI tooling, now is the time to get involved — star the repo, fork it, or just stick around. 🚀

---

## ⭐ Support the Project

If OpenClip saves you time (or money on paid tools), please consider leaving a **star** on GitHub — it genuinely helps more people discover this project and motivates continued development.

**[⭐ Star this repo](https://github.com/aionix/openclip)** — it takes 2 seconds and means a lot.

## What is OpenClip?

OpenClip is a **free, open-source, local-first** alternative to paid video clipping tools like OpusClip, Vidyo.ai, and Munch.

- No subscriptions. No watermarks. No cloud uploads.
- Everything runs **on your machine**.
- Powered by AI for smart clip detection.

## Quick Start

### One-Line Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aionixos/openclip.git && cd openclip && bash setup.sh
```

Or if you've already cloned the repo:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

Then start the app:

```bash
bash start.sh
```

This will start:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend:** http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/docs

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 18+**
- **FFmpeg** installed and on PATH

> The setup script will check all dependencies and install yt-dlp automatically if needed.

## Contributing

OpenClip is open to contributors of all levels. If you find a bug, have a feature idea, or want to help build the roadmap — open an issue or a PR. All contributions are welcome.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1. Do I need to pay for anything?**
```
No. OpenClip is 100% free and local.
You only need an API key from your chosen LLM provider.
All providers have free tiers:
  Gemini 1.5 Flash → 1,500 requests/day free
  Ollama           → completely free, runs locally
  OpenAI/Anthropic → paid but cheap (~$0.01 per video)
FFmpeg, yt-dlp, Python, Node — all free.
```

---

**Q2. Where is my data stored?**
```
Everything stays on your computer. Nothing goes to any cloud.
  Videos    → /tmp folder on your machine
  Database  → /data/openclip.db (SQLite file)
  Settings  → same SQLite file, API keys encrypted
  Clips     → /tmp/{project_id}/clips/

The only external calls are:
  yt-dlp   → YouTube (to download)
  LLM API  → your chosen provider (transcript only)
```

---

**Q3. How do I add my API key?**
```
1. Open OpenClip in browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. Click Settings (gear icon, top right)
3. Choose your LLM provider from dropdown
4. Paste your API key
5. Click Save

Your key is encrypted and stored locally.
It never leaves your machine except to call the LLM API.
```

---

**Q4. FFmpeg is not working / not found**
```
FFmpeg must be installed separately. Steps:

Windows:
  1. Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
  2. Extract zip
  3. Add bin/ folder to System PATH
  4. Restart terminal
  5. Test: ffmpeg -version

Mac:
  brew install ffmpeg

Linux:
  sudo apt install ffmpeg

Then restart OpenClip backend.
```

---

**Q5. Can I contribute if I only know frontend / only know Python?**
```
Yes. The project is split cleanly:

Frontend only (Next.js/TypeScript):
  Look for issues labeled "frontend"
  You never need to touch Python

Backend only (Python/FastAPI):
  Look for issues labeled "backend"
  You never need to touch React

Docs only:
  Look for issues labeled "documentation"
  Just markdown, no code needed

Design only:
  Look for issues labeled "design"
  Figma or CSS improvements welcome
```

---

**Q6. My video failed to process, what do I do?**
```
Check in this order:

1. Is FFmpeg installed?
   Run: ffmpeg -version

2. Is the video public?
   Private/age-restricted videos cannot be downloaded.

3. Did the LLM fail?
   Check your API key in Settings.
   Check your provider's quota/limits.

4. Check terminal logs:
   Backend terminal shows exact error.
   Copy the error and open a GitHub Issue.

5. Try a shorter video first (under 10 minutes)
   to verify your setup works.
```
---

**Q7. How do I suggest a feature or report a bug?**
```
Feature idea:
  Go to GitHub → Discussions → Ideas
  Describe what you want and why.
  Upvote existing ideas you agree with.

Bug report:
  Go to GitHub → Issues → New Issue
  Choose "Bug Report" template
  Fill in all fields including your terminal error.

Want to build something yourself:
  Comment on the issue "I'll work on this"
  Fork the repo, build it, open a Pull Request.
  We review and merge if it's good.
